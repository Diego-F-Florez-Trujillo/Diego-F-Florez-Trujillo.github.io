# Welcome to My Portfolio

I am a university professor specializing in **Simulation, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**, and **Python programming**. This website showcases my professional achievements, courses, and ongoing projects.

## University Courses
Here are some of the courses I currently teach:

- **Introduction to Python Programming**: Basic principles of Python for engineering applications.
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**: Fundamentals of FEA and its application in mechanical design.
- **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**: Simulating fluid behavior using cutting-edge tools.
- **Aerodynamics for Vehicles**: Principles and simulation techniques for automotive aerodynamics.
- **Engineering Simulations with Python**: Python-based approaches for solving engineering problems.

Feel free to explore the [projects](./courses.md) section for a detailed view of my work.
